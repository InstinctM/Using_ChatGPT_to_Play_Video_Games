To return to the Overworld from the Nether in Minecraft, you'll need to find and enter a Nether portal. In the image you've provided, there's a Nether portal visible on the left side of the screen. Here's how to reach it: 1. First, face the portal, which appears to be on a lower level compared to your current position. Carefully move towards it while avoiding any drops that could cause damage. 2. Use the blocks of netherrack in your inventory to build a safe path if needed. Select the netherrack in your hotbar (it looks like you already have it selected). 3. To place a block, aim at the location you want the block to be and right-click (if you are using a mouse) or press the left trigger (if you are using a game controller). Create a staircase or a bridge to safely descend to the level of the portal. 4. Watch out for any nearby Ghasts or other Nether creatures that might attack you. Their presence is indicated by the sounds they make or by seeing them in your vicinity. If you see a Ghast (a large, white floating creature that shoots explosive fireballs), avoid open areas where you might be an easy target. 5. As you reach the portal, make sure it's active. An active portal will display a swirling purple effect inside the frame. If the portal is not active (perhaps it's been deactivated by a Ghast's fireball), you will need to relight it. Since your inventory doesn't show a flint and steel or a fire charge, look for nearby burning blocks or lava to ignite a fire next to the portal frame, which can sometimes activate the portal. 6. Once the portal is active, step inside, and stay still. After a short period, you will be transported back to the Overworld. Remember, while in the Nether, always be cautious and take your time when navigating the terrain to minimize the risk of falling into lava or taking fall damage. If you need to build across lava, crouch by pressing the shift key (on a keyboard) or the crouch button (on a controller) to avoid accidentally falling off the edge while placing blocks.
